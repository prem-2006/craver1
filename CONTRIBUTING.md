New content filling important gaps in our documentation. For example, this pull request added a useful section on security hardening for GitHub Actions.
Content we do not currently accept:

Edits purely for tone, readability, or efficiency
Topics that are too niche or a matter of personal preference
Changes to the underlying site and workflows

Writing style guidelines
When contributing content, please follow these key principles from our style guide:

Clarity and simplicity: The goal of our writing style is clarity and simplicity.
Meaning over grammar: Grammatical correctness is important, but not as important as clarity and meaning.
Second person: The docs use second-person ("you") to communicate directly with readers.
Inclusive language: Use inclusive language by not assuming gender or ability level, and by avoiding slang and idioms.
Accessible technical language: Jargon is sometimes necessary, but don't assume every reader has your technical expertise.
Active voice: Use active voice wherever possible. Active voice means avoiding "be" verbs like "is" or "are" when you can, but also choosing more dynamic verbs to get your point across. "Press (a key)" is less dynamic than "tap (a key)," for example.
Clear terminology: Avoid technical abbreviations like "repo" and "PR," and Latin abbreviations like "i.e." and "e.g."
For complete style guidance, see our style guide.

Windows
This site can be developed on Windows, however a few potential gotchas need to be kept in mind:

Regular Expressions: Windows uses \r\n for line endings, while Unix-based systems use \n. Therefore, when working on Regular Expressions, use \r?\n instead of \n in order to support both environments. The Node.js os.EOL property can be used to get an OS-specific end-of-line marker.
Paths: Windows systems use \ for the path separator, which would be returned by path.join and others. You could use path.posix, path.posix.join etc and the slash module, if you need forward slashes - like for constructing URLs - or ensure your code works with either.
Bash: Not every Windows developer has a terminal that fully supports Bash, so it's generally preferred to write scripts in JavaScript instead of Bash.
Filename too long error: There is a 260 character limit for a filename when Git is compiled with msys. While the suggestions below are not guaranteed to work and could cause other issues, a few workarounds include:
Update Git configuration: git config --system core.longpaths true
Consider using a different Git client on Windows
